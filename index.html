        <h3>What is this?</h3>
        <h5>This is an automated testing system. It pulls all of its questions from two websites:
            <a href='https://nurseslabs.com'>NurseLabs</a> and
            <a href='http://currentnursing.com'>CurrentNursing</a>. As questions are pulled in an automated fashion, there may be a small number of questions
            that the computer misreads and either do not show up correctly or have an incorrect answer.
            <b>This should be rare</b>, but please just continue to the next question if it happens.</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <input type="checkbox" id="adaptive_test" onclick="adaptiveTestQs()" checked>
                <b>Adaptive test</b>: the system will give you progressively more questions in any categories you answer questions
                wrong. After at least 3 questions in any major category are answered, the computer
                will continually reanalyze your failure rate. If your failure rate is below 20 percent, the system will reduce
                the number of future questions from that category to a minimum. As your failure rate trends up, the system will
                increase the number of questions from that category on a ramp proportional to your failure rate. As more questions from 
                thst major category are answered, the system will perform the same failure analysis for each subcategory under it.

                <input type="checkbox" id="only_rationale" onclick="rationaleOnlyQs()">
                <b>Only with rationale</b>: many questions in the system do not have rationales attached to them. Only with
                rationale reduces the number of available questions to only show those with a rationale</input>
